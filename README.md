# The-Dungeon-Game

This Project was made by a small group of friends ranging from really smart to the person that so dumb they're smart (In they're own way).

This game isn't meant to be the best, it's only meant to be a beginning project for us.

We love doing these things and would love to hear feedback on the things we do.
When we say feedback we mean any kind. From bugs to even suggestion on how to make the game better. We want to hear it.
When we get better at doing these things we're thinking about making a remastered version of this game, and we will listen to any and all suggestions.

Any and all bugs that someone finds and reports will be dealt with ASAP.
